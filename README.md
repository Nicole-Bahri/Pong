# Pong game 	:tennis:

Building a version of the pong game in Pygame and Python.

Pong is one of the first computer games that were ever created, this simple "tennis like" game features two paddles and a ball, the goal is to defeat your opponent 
by being the first one to gain 20 points, a player gets a point once the opponent misses a ball. The game can be played with two human players.
